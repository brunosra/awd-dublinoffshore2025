      # The `pages` pages section shows other main pages of the site
      # Using the `templates` option, we limit which types of pages are shown
      # Using the `create` option, we limit the type of page that can be created when a new page is created
      # Note that the `sandbox` page and the `error` page that also exist in the content folder but use different blueprints thus do not show up in the list
      # Since the error page's blueprint is set to `read: false`, it wouldn't show up here even if you added the error blueprint to the templates list
