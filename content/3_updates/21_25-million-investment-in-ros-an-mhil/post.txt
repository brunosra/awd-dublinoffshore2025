Last year, together with our partners, we delivered an assessment of the market opportunity for Ros an Mhíl highlighting the job creation potential that floating wind projects in particular can bring to rural communities. The report for&nbsp;Údarás na Gaeltachta&nbsp;was widely cited in laying out the job creation opportunity and the unique benefits of Ros an Mhíl as an O&amp;M hub on the West Coast.</p><p>Ros an Mhíl has the potential to be a strategic hub with an important role to play in supporting the significant pipeline of Floating Offshore Wind on the West Coast of Ireland. The proximity of Ros an Mhíl Harbour to offshore project locations and the introduction of a deep berth provide the opportunity for the cost effective and timely entry into the offshore energy market.</p><p>The investment will also kick-start plans to deliver green energy off the West coast of Ireland by taking a major step to address logistical bottlenecks associated with build out of major offshore projects such as floating offshore wind farms.</p><p>At Dublin Offshore we use our knowledge of the full project value chain to deliver robust advice to support decision making, guide policy direction and to deliver value for our clients. For engineering with real impact contact Dublin Offshore.</p>"},"id":"447b2917-6dba-4374-9987-4028443e7ba3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
