The sites for floating wind many – once you’re into that deeper water it really opens up a huge expanse of ocean and the challenge is to be able to put platforms out there safely and cost-effectively</em>.</p><p><em>“We are working on the technology development in-house. It has gotten as far as testing offshore, being demonstrated in the Irish Atlantic”.</em></p><p>Danny also spoke about the Marine Energy Alliance project, which supported the company in one of its calls for project. As part of the project, <a href=\"https://dublinoffshore.ie/updates/emec-issues-compliance-report-for-dublin-offshore-mooring-component\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Dublin Offshore worked with the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)</a> to certify the offshore demonstration technology, which boosted the company’s confidence into the liability and viability of the technology. </p><p></p>"},"id":"6613b986-fa62-4c7a-941b-f08065154490","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
