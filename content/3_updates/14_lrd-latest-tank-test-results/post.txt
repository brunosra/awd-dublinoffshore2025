This reduction was achieved during a 1 in 50 year storm event.<\/p><p>The anchor radius was substantially reduced from 852m to 355m. The overall platform footprint area has reduced by 83% and there are no longer any mooring lines in contact with the seabed eliminating thrashing and the associated seabed \/ mooring line damage.<\/p><p>Similar platform heave and surge response for catenary systems and inclined taut systems. This is a design choice made in specifying the test based on maintaining the baseline envelope. Further design choices can reduce excursion if required as identified by dynamic cable design. The reduced pitch and platform accelerations will also reduce loading on the dynamic cable.<\/p><p>Nacelle accelerations are significantly reduced by use of ITM systems.<\/p><p><\/p>"},"id":"34e085c6-7828-46fe-bfbb-ec81c11ce1e3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
