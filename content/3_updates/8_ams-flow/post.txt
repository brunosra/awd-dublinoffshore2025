This groundbreaking project, supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the SEAI Research, Development &amp; Demonstration Funding Programme 2023, marks a significant milestone in advancing the Floating Offshore Wind (FLOW) sector.</p><p>Dublin Offshore's expertise in the design of innovative mooring systems and analysis of FOW platforms will be instrumental in creating an early-stage decision-making tool for FLOW. Additionally, Dublin Offshore will explore new use cases and applications for the Load Reduction Device (LRD) as part of this pioneering research endeavour.</p><p>The AMS-FLOW project, spanning three years, aims to deliver a comprehensive set of technical and financial outputs tailored to the specific needs of the FLOW sector. Collaborating partners include University College Cork (UCC), Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), and Exceedence Ltd., in addition to Dublin Offshore.</p><p>Ireland's rich wind resource, coupled with some of the world's highest wind speeds, presents both opportunities and challenges for the FLOW sector. The extreme environmental conditions, including waves exceeding 30 meters on the west coast, necessitate innovative solutions for the successful deployment of FLOW technology. The AMS-FLOW project seeks to address these challenges while enhancing the competitiveness of FLOW technology in Ireland.</p><p>Speaking about the recent project kick-off Dr Tom Doyle, Technical Director at Dublin Offshore, said, \"Dublin Offshore are dedicated to advancing floating wind in Ireland and we look forward to working closely with our project partners. This project will help developers to build in the benefits of LRD-optimised moorings from the start, leading to accelerated build out and reduced cost of energy for consumers.\"</p><p>For more information on the AMS-FLOW project and Dublin Offshore's role in the project, please contact us using the information below.</p><p>Contact:<br>Dublin Offshore Technology (DOT) Ltd.<br><a href=\"mailto:info@dublinoffshore.ie\">info@dublinoffshore.ie</a></p><p>About Dublin Offshore Technology (DOT) Ltd.:<br>Dublin Offshore Technology (DOT) Ltd. is a leading provider of innovative solutions for offshore energy projects.
